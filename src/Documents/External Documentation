== A. Execution ==

Using Project Structure to create a .jar file in the Intellij, then Build Artifacts to build it
Finally, go to out folder to find .jar file and run it

Also, you can run some startup java in the startup package. After finishing the program, it will print some data
that you typed in.

Moreover, you can use console version  and GUI version or dialog version to test and try and check some features.

== B. Status ==

I think I did a pretty good test case for this project. Most of the features were tested.

Just in different user interface versions have some small error. Most of features are working fine. However, some are not.

For example, when I test GUI version, it cannot check my input health number whether the number is with patient or not,
which it still can pass the window, and it cannot show up message,
but the number cannot get in the patient container and overwrite it. Add Doctor has a similar problem.
Assign Doctor to Patient has another story that is once check some errors, you cannot be able to do any options.

== C. Maintenance ==

Since the three-layer architecture design, users can be easy to change a new GUI version like from dialog to a combine frame.
Also, users can add some features into some classes in the entities package. The three-layer architecture design make the
program more robuster because users add any features and class that does not any error or link to the program, and the main
program still can work originally.
